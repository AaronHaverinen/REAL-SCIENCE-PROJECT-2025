        <p>The last class is Fish or more specifically, Actinopterygii. Jawed fish are categorized into two superclasses: Chondrichtyes and Osteichthyes, the first one being cartilaginous and the latter being bony. The Actinopterygii is a type of bony fish, which has ray fins, unlike Sarcopterygii who have lobe fins. Fish have an closed circulatory system (cold-blodded) with bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through external fertilizaiton. Fish breathe through countercurrent exchange where they use gills to exchange oxygen in the water for carbon dioxide. The fish I am showcasing here is the European Perch, known as the <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>. Their habitat is really any freshwater source like lakes and they live primarily in Europe and parts of Siberia. A European Perch's lifespan is around 7-10 years, reaching a maximum of 22. Their diet consists of zooplankton for juveniles and invertibrates as well as other fish like minnows for the mature.</p>
