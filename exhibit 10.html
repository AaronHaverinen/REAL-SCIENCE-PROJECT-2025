        <p>You are a mammal! Not this mammal above, which is the Siberian Tiger, but a mammal nonetheless (unless you are a bird or some other animal reading this). Anyway, mammals are probably the class of animals (in phylum Chordata) that you are most familiar with. It can encompass a wide variety of creatures like whales, lions, tigers, humans, monkeys, dogs, etc. Mammals have bilateral symmetry and reproduce through internal fertilization. Almost all mammals are viviparous, meaning that they produce life young. A mammal has a closed circulatory system with four chambers in their hearts. The hair of a mammal is for insulation of the heat and the mammary glands are for producing milk for babies. Mammals are the only class that do this. Additionally, mammals have sweat glands, which help them regulate temperature. They are endothermic, so they can stay warm in cold climates. Also, there are three main types of mammals: monotremes, who lay eggs, marsupials, who give birth to underdeveloped young that continue to grow in a pouch, and placentals (that’s us), who use a placenta to feed babies. As I have mentioned before, this is the Siberian Tiger, or <i>Panthera tigris altaica</i> (this has three scientific names because Siberian Tiger is a subspecies of tiger). They are carnivorous, meaning that they eat other animals, or at least meat in general. The Siberian Tiger’s life span is thirty to forty years in places like Russia, North Korea, and Northern China.</p>
