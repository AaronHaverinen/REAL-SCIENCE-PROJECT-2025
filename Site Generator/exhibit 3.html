        <p>These are mollusca, a phylum that you're probably a bit familiar with. Their symmetry pattern is bilateral. Mollusca differ from other phyla because they actually have multiple hearts in their open circulatory system. Mollusca reproduce sexually through external fertilization, unlike most animals who reproduce internally. Some mollusks have shells and some do not, but all of them do have a mantle for protection. Above, I am showcasing the Giant Pacific Octopus, also known scientifically as the <i>Enteroctopus dofleini</i>. Their lifespan is around 3â€“5 years in the Pacific Ocean. Also, the Giant Pacific Octopus' diet can range from shrimp and crab to lobster and even more. As some fun facts, octopuses in general can change their color to camouflage with surroundings and can squirt ink to get away from enemies. And also, this specific octopus has nine brains! It has one central one for control and dominion over the other eight, which control each arm. How lucky. Imagine how much more innovation there would be if we each had nine brains! I'm just joking. Below is the taxonomy.</p>
