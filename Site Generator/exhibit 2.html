        <p>Cnidaria is just a fancy Latin word for this phylum, which includes jellyfish, corals, and many others. Cnidaria are unique because they are the only phylum that has both the medusa and polyp stages. If you do not know what this means, it is completely OK. A jellyfish will start from an egg, then grow into a polyp, attached to the ground and commonly mistaken as a plant or even sponge, and then finally grow into a medusa with its large bell and tentacles. Cnidaria, like sponges, produce both sexually and asexually too. The asexual way works with budding, where the cnidarian can break off a bit of its body and then grow a new cnidarian out of it. Sexual reproduction works similarly to other animals by releasing sperm to fertilize females. Cnidaria also have tentacles, whose purpose is to sting and catch prey. This serves as an advantage to being a predator in the ocean. A funny fact about cnidaria is that they look like mushrooms. The cnidarian I've decided to showcase today is the Lion's Mane Jellyfish, also known by its boring name, the <i>Cyanea capillata</i>. This humongous jellyfish can grow tentacles as long as a hundred feet and its bell's circumference up to thirty feet! It lives in the cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific Oceans. However, this glorious jellyfish only lives about twelve months, which is nothing compared to some other sea creatures. Its diet consists of zooplankton, small fish, and maybe even some other jellyfish occasionally.</p>
