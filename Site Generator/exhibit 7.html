        <p>This next phylum will be chordata, with our last five animals being classes of that phylum. The first class is Aves. Aves are the first class that I will show you of vertebrates. Aves have an closed circulatory system with bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through internal fertilizaiton. Aves have wings and are really the only phylum that can fly. The bird I am showcasing here is the Blue Jay, known as the <i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>. Their habitat is usually mised woodlnads in Northeastern America and their lifespan is around 7 years. The blue jay's diet consists of seeds, nuts, and insects.</p>
