        <p>Now aves (which means birds in Latin) is not actually a phylum and is a class (subcategory) of the phylum Chordata. Birds are bilaterally symmetric and they reproduce through internal fertilization, laying eggs. This makes them oviparous. Their eggs contain yolks for the embryo to feed off of instead of a placenta (like in mammals). Their hearts have four chambers and birds’ circulatory systems are all closed. Birds have really cool skin because it is specially adapted for flight and certain environmental conditions, similar to reptiles and mammals. Birds are endothermic and this helps with giving them access to a wider range of climates, allowing them to stay active during all times of the day or year. It also gives them more stamina. Birds have evolved to fly easier through physical adaptations, for example, they have hollow strong bones, a keeled sternum for flight muscle attachment and specialized wings with light feathers. Here’s a fun fact about birds: birds are actually closely evolutionary related to dinosaurs. Also, did you know that birds fly in a V-shape to save energy? The bird I am showcasing today is the Blue Jay, or <i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>. Their habitat is mixed woodlands in North America and they live for around seven years on average. Their diet consists of seeds, nuts, and even other insects.</p>
