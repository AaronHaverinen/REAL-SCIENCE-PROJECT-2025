        <p>Amphibians are really cool because they can breathe through both their lungs and their skin! Amphibian means '2 lives' in Greek. Unfortunately, amphibians aren't a phylum alone, and are part of the vertebrate phylum Chordata. Amphibians have bilateral symmetry with sexual reproduction that involves external fertilization. These oviparous creatures have a fascinating way of reproduction where the male will spread their sperm onto the eggs laid in the water by the female. But wait, amphibians are land animals, no? Well, as I have mentioned before, amphibian means '2 lives' in Greek. This means that they technically live two lives: one on land and one in the water. Amphibia are born in the water as eggs and then hatch into something like tadpoles. Then, the tadpoles start to lose their gills and grow lungs so that they can live on dry land. The amphibian that I'd like to show you all today is the American Bullfrog or the <i>Lithobates catesbeianus</i>. The American Bullfrog's habitat is obvious in America, near lakes or ponds. Their lifespan is 7–10 years. The American bullfrogs diet can consist of small bugs, insects, other amphibians, and really anything else it can find.</p>
