        <p>The next class is Amphibian. Amphibians have an closed circulatory system with bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through external fertilizaiton. Amphibians usually start off in the water, but then gradually go to living on land. The amphibian I am showcasing here is the American Bullfrog, known as the <i>Lythobates catesbeianus</i>. Their habitat is usually lakes, ponds, or marshes and they live for around 7-10 years. The American Bullfrog's diet consists of insects, grasshoppers, beetles, spiders, etc.</p>
