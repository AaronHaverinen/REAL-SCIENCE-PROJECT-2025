        <p>Our next class of chordata will be Reptiles. This is a cold-blooded (meaning their blood temperature changes with the environment) type of vertebrate which usually has scaly skin. Reptiles have closed circulatory systems with one heart. Reptiles have bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through internal fertilization. The reptile here today is the Freshwater Crocodile, or <i>Crocodylus johnstoni</i>. This animal lives in freshwater lakes and wetlands usually located in Australia. Their lifespan is 30 to 40 years. The freshwater crocodile's diet can be amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and even other reptiles.</p>
