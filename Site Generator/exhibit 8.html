        <p>Reptiles aren't a phylum and are part of the phylum Chordata. Instead, reptiles are a class, and are also categorized with amphibians in a colloquial superclass herps (which is not a scientific classificatory name). Reptiles are symmetrical bilaterally and reproduce sexually through internal fertilization and are usually oviparous but sometimes can also be viviparous or ovoviviparous (a mouthful to say). Reptiles produce an amniotic egg, meaning that the egg provides shelter and doesn't need moisture (it is held inside the egg). Reptiles also have scaly skin, which helps they be protected from abrasion and dehydration. Their circulatory system is closed with four chambers in their heart. Reptiles are cold-blooded, or <i>exothermic</i>, meaning that their blood temperature changes with their environment. This is helpful in saving energy for the reptile because they don't need to produce their own heat; instead they can lie in the sun. A fun fact is that snake charming actually doesn't hypnotize the snake with the music, but instead uses the movement of the performer to trip up the snake so it doesn't know when or where to strike. The reptile I have for you all today is the Freshwater Crocodile, or the <i>Crocodylus johnstoni</i>. This animal lives in freshwater lakes and wetlands, usually located in Australia and its lifespan is 30â€“40 years. The freshwater crocodile's diet can range from amphibians to even other reptiles or mammals.</p>
