        "description": "Though it may not seem as such, sea sponges are actually animals, and not plants. Sailors used to collect them to make dishwashing equipment (what now is synthetic). Now, porifera are mostly asymmetrical, reproducing both sexually and asexually. But this seems a bit strange. How can an animal reproduce both sexually and asexually? Well actually, asexual reproduction with porifera (or sponges) works via fragmentation, budding, or gemmules. Sexual reproduction occurs through releasing sperm or egg cells, where they float through the water to find another sponge, fertilizing it. However, sponges don't have true tissues or organs and are sessile, meaning not moving. Some fun facts about porifera are that they are filter-feeders, meaning that they filter water through themselves to extract the solids dissolved (i.e. plankton). This beauty above is the Giant Barrel Sponge, also known scientifically (or by its fancy name), <i>Xestospongia muta</i>. Their habitat is along the Caribbean and Gulf of America, most commonly on coral reefs. The Giant Barrel Sponge has a really long life span of around 2000 years! That means some sponges that are still living in our ocean today may have been alive when Jesus was doing his ministry! The Giant Barrel Sponge feeds on bacteria, plankton, prochlorophytes, and really any other nutrition dissolved in the water. It is not that picky. Another fun fact about sponges is that they are called porifera because of their many pores. Below is the taxonomy.",

        "title": "Exhibit 2: Cnidaria",
        "description": "Cnidaria is just a fancy Latin word for this phylum, which includes jellyfish, corals, and many others. Cnidaria are unique because they are the only phylum that has both the medusa and polyp stages. If you do not know what this means, it is completely OK. A jellyfish will start from an egg, then grow into a polyp, attached to the ground and commonly mistaken as a plant or even sponge, and then finally grow into a medusa with its large bell and tentacles. Cnidaria, like sponges, produce both sexually and asexually too. The asexual way works with budding, where the cnidarian can break off a bit of its body and then grow a new cnidarian out of it. Sexual reproduction works similarly to other animals by releasing sperm to fertilize females. Cnidaria also have tentacles, whose purpose is to sting and catch prey. This serves as an advantage to being a predator in the ocean. A funny fact about cnidaria is that they look like mushrooms. The cnidarian I've decided to showcase today is the Lion's Mane Jellyfish, also known by its boring name, the <i>Cyanea capillata</i>. This humongous jellyfish can grow tentacles as long as a hundred feet and its bell's circumference up to thirty feet! It lives in the cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific Oceans. However, this glorious jellyfish only lives about twelve months, which is nothing compared to some other sea creatures. Its diet consists of zooplankton, small fish, and maybe even some other jellyfish occasionally. Below is the taxonomy.",

        "description": "These are mollusca, a phylum that you're probably a bit familiar with. Their symmetry pattern is bilateral. Mollusca differ from other phyla because they actually have multiple hearts in their open circulatory system. Mollusca reproduce sexually through external fertilization, unlike most animals who reproduce internally. Some mollusks have shells and some do not, but all of them do have a mantle for protection. Above, I am showcasing the Giant Pacific Octopus, also known scientifically as the <i>Enteroctopus dofleini</i>. Their lifespan is around 3â€“5 years in the Pacific Ocean. Also, the Giant Pacific Octopus' diet can range from shrimp and crab to lobster and even more. As some fun facts, octopuses in general can change their color to camouflage with surroundings and can squirt ink to get away from enemies. And also, this specific octopus has nine brains! It has one central one for control and dominion over the other eight, which control each arm. How lucky. Imagine how much more innovation there would be if we each had nine brains! I'm just joking.

        "description": "Now this phylum has a weird name (not saying that the others don't but yeah), annelida. There's nothing really too <i>special</i> about them, though they can see light without even any eyes and they breathe through a moist layer of water on their skin. That's why you can see that earthworms die when dried in the sun for a while. Annelids have bilateral symmetry and reproduce sexually, even though they are both genders at once! They rub against each other and exchange DNA to keep the line going. Their circulatory system is closed with some sort of heart-like structure. Their digestive system is complete, running all the way from their mouth to anus. Now this annelid that I have decided to show all of you today is the Red Tiger Worm, the <i>Eisenia andrei</i> (named by some scientists). This worm lives for around 5 years, usually residing in composts or dung heaps, or sometimes underground. It eats basically any decomposing matter it can find, usually some sort of produce. There really isn't much else to say. Below is the taxonomy.",

Arthropoda reproduce sexually and have two different types of metamorphosis: complete and incomplete. The complete metamorphosis has four stages with a larva and pupa while incomplete has three with a nymph. The animal I am showcasing for this phylum is the American Lobster, known as the <i>Homarus americanus</i>. The American Lobster lives for around 100 years in the cold wwaters of the northwest pacific in the eastcoast of the United States. Its diet can range from mollusks to worms to urchins and more.

You may have seen these wash up on the beach and think these are just cool rocks or dead plants, but these are actually animals. Echinodermata can include starfish, sand dollars, and even sea urchins. Echinodermata have bilateral symmetry when they are immature but grow into radial (or pentaradial) symmetry when fully grown. Echinodermata reproduce mainly via sexual reproduction but can also exhibit assexual reproduction through fragmentation. The echinodermatum that I have decided to show you all is the Common Starfish, or <i>Asterias rubens</i>. These Starfish live in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean for around 5 to 10 years. Their diet is carnivorous, hosting mollusks like clams, mussels, and barnacles.",
