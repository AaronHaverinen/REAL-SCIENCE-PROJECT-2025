        <p>Now this phylum has a weird name (not saying that the others don't but yeah), annelida. There's nothing really too <i>special</i> about them, though they can see light without even any eyes and they breathe through a moist layer of water on their skin. That's why you can see that earthworms die when dried in the sun for a while. Annelids have bilateral symmetry and reproduce sexually, even though they are both genders at once! They rub against each other and exchange DNA to keep the line going. Their circulatory system is closed with some sort of heart-like structure. Their digestive system is complete, running all the way from their mouth to anus. Now this annelid that I have decided to show all of you today is the Red Tiger Worm, the <i>Eisenia andrei</i> (named by some scientists). This worm lives for around 5 years, usually residing in composts or dung heaps, or sometimes underground. It eats basically any decomposing matter it can find, usually some sort of produce. There really isn't much else to say.</p>
