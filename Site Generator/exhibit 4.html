        <p>The next phylum is Annelida. These animals have bilateral symmetry and you might also know these and worms. The most notable of these are actually earthwarms. Annelida reproduce sexually, though they are both genders at once. They have a closed circulatory system with no heart. Instead, they have bloods through capilaries in their body. Their digestive system is complete, running from mouth to anus. And even though they have no eyes, annelida can still sense the presence of light. Today, I am using the Red Tiger Worm, the <i>Eisenia Andrei</i>, as our example. This earthworm lives around 5 years in usually compost or dung heaps. The diet of this animal is reall yjust any type of decomposing matter, usually produce.</p>
