        <p>The most confusing taxonomy, Pisces! So fish are actually a super-super-superclass (or just clade because they don't have a technical name) of the super-superclasses (or also clades) agnathans and gnathostomes (jawless vs jawed fish respectively), gnathostomes of which contain the superclasses chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, which are cartilaginous fish and bony fish respectively. But under those superclasses come the class of the fish that is shown above: actinopterygii. Actinopterygii are jawed bony fish who have ray fins, unlike sarcopterygii who have lobe fins. Fish have bilateral symmetry and sexually fertilize externally through eggs. Fish lay eggs, making them oviparous. Their circulatory system is closed with two chambers in their heart. They have a special way of gas exchange, called countercurrent, which uses gills to take out oxygen from the water and turn it into carbon dioxide. This above is the European Perch (Ahven), or <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>. Its habitat can just be any freshwater lake, usually in Europe and parts of Siberia. A European Perch's lifespan is around 7-10 years, reaching a maximum of 22. Their diet consists of zooplankton for juveniles and invertebrates as well as other fish like minnows for the mature.</p>
