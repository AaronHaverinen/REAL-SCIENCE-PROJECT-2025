        <p>The next class is Mammals. Mammals have an closed circulatory system with bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through internal fertilizaiton. Mammals have warm blood and they feed their young with milk from teh mammary gland, unique amongst the other classes. The mammals I am showcasing here is the Siberian Tiger, known as the <i>Panthera tigris altaica</i>. Their habitat is usually forests in eastern Russia, Northeastern China, and North Korea and they live on average for only 10-15 years. The Siberian Tiger's diet consists of elk, boar, deer, water buffalo, and other similar animals.</p>
