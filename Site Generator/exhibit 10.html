        <p>You are a mammal! Not this mammal above, which is the Siberian Tiger, but a mammal nonetheless (unless you are a bird or some other animal reading this). Anyway, mammals are probably the class of animals (in phylum Chordata) that you are most familiar with. It can encompass a wide variety of creatures like whales, lions, tigers, humans, monkeys, dogs, etc.</p>
