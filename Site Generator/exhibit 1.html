        <p>Though it may not seem as such, sea sponges are actually animals, and not plants. Sailors used to collect them to make dishwashing equipment (what now is synthetic). Now, porifera are mostly asymmetrical, reproducing both sexually and asexually. But this seems a bit strange. How can an animal reproduce both sexually and asexually? Well actually, asexual reproduction with porifera (or sponges) works via fragmentation, budding, or gemmules. Sexual reproduction occurs through releasing sperm or egg cells, where they float through the water to find another sponge, fertilizing it. However, sponges don't have true tissues or organs and are sessile, meaning not moving. Some fun facts about porifera are that they are filter-feeders, meaning that they filter water through themselves to extract the solids dissolved (i.e. plankton). This beauty above is the Giant Barrel Sponge, also known scientifically (or by its fancy name), <i>Xestospongia muta</i>. Their habitat is along the Caribbean and Gulf of America, most commonly on coral reefs. The Giant Barrel Sponge has a really long life span of around 2000 years! That means some sponges that are still living in our ocean today may have been alive when Jesus was doing his ministry! The Giant Barrel Sponge feeds on bacteria, plankton, prochlorophytes, and really any other nutrition dissolved in the water. It is not that picky. Another fun fact about sponges is that they are called porifera because of their many pores.</p>
