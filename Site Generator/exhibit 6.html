        <p>Some people love this phylum and others think it's boring and there is nothing special. But honestly, echinodermata are one of the most fascinating creatures in the entire ocean. You may have seen them wash up on the beach and think that these are just some cool rocks or dead plants, but there is actually something much more to them. Echinodermata are not just the shell, but have skin too, hence their name which translates to <i>spikey skin</i>. These can include starfish, sand dollars and even sea urchins! Echinoderms have pentaradial symmetry (or just radial if you don't feel like saying it all) and reproduce sexually through external fertilization. They have a water vascular system as their circulatory system, where water flows through them for locomotion, feeding, respiration, et cetera. Their digestive system is quite interesting too. Some vent food from their mouth instead of secreting it from their anus. This is the Common Starfish, or <i>Asterias rubens</i>. These starfish (or sea stars) live in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean for around 5 to 10 years. Their diet is pretty carnivorous (meaning meat-eating), hosting mollusks like clams, mussels, and even barnacles.</p>
