        <p>This phylum is the last invertibrate one before we move onto vertebrates. You may have seen these wash up on the beach and think these are just cool rocks or dead plants, but these are actually animals. Echinodermata can include starfish, sand dollars, and even sea urchins. Echinodermata have bilateral symmetry when they are immature but grow into radial (or pentaradial) symmetry when fully grown. Echinodermata reproduce mainly via sexual reproduction but can also exhibit assexual reproduction through fragmentation. The echinodermatum that I have decided to show you all is the Common Starfish, or <i>Asterias rubens</i>. These Starfish live in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean for around 5 to 10 years. Their diet is carnivorous, hosting mollusks like clams, mussels, and barnacles.</p>
