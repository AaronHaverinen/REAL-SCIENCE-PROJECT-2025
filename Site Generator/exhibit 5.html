        <p>I'm certain that you have encountered this phylum before, but maybe not its name. This is arthropoda and it carries a very wide variety of creatures, in fact, so wide that this is the largest phylum, carrying more than 85% of all animal creatures! This phylum carries insects, crustaceans, and many others that could be crawling in your backyard, or living on the ocean floor. Now, this phylum has bilateral symmetry, with an open circulatory system. Their circulatory system runs on hemolymph, which is somewhat similar to blood, just a bit different and they pump it though their one-chambered heart. Arthropods' reproduction system occurs through internal fertilization, which means the reproduction is sexual. Arthropods also have a unique outer shell called an exoskeleton. This fancy word describes their hard outer covering, which can be used for protection, support, and a surface for muscle attachment. Metamorphosis is something that happens when arthropods start to grow, which has two types: incomplete and complete. Complete metamorphosis has four stages, starting from an egg, then hatching into the larva, then growing into a pupa, then turning into a fully-grown adult. Incomplete metamorphosis has only three steps, replacing the larva and pupa stages with just a nymph. A nymph is basically an immature adult, an altered version and younger. The arthropod that I'd like to show today is the American Lobster, or <i>Homarus americanus</i>, which has incomplete metamorphosis. It lives for around 50â€“100 years in shallow, cold coastal areas that have saltwater. They are distributed along the Northeastern coast of the United States. Its diet consists mostly of dead animals, clams, crabs, urchins, and even more.</p>
