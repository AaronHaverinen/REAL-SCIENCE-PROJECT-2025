        <h2>The Giant Pacific Octopus</h2>
        <p>These are Mollusca, also known as Mollusks. Mollusca can have multiple hearts in their open circulatory system. This phylum differs from Porifera and Cnidaria because it actually has blood to circulate. Mollusca have bilateral symmetry, producing sexually through external fertilization. Some Mollusca have shells while others do not. Here I am showcasing the Giant Pacific Octopus, known taxonomically as the Enteroctopus dofleini. This is a type of Mollusca that does not have a shell, like squids. However, all mollusca do have a mantel for protection. The Giant Pacific Octopus lives only about 3-5 years in the Pacific Ocean (as described in the name). Its diet can include shrimp, crab, scallops, lobster, and other seafood of that type. As a fun fact, this octopus has nine brains! It has one central one and one for each arm. How lucky.</p>
