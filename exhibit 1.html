        <h2>The Giant Barrel Sponge</h2>
    <p>Our first animal phylum is called Porifera. Though it may not seem like it, sponges are actually animals and not plants. Porifera have neither organs nor true tissues but can produce both sexually and asexually through releasing sperm/eggs or budding, gemmules, and fragmentation. Additionally, Porifera are mostly assymetrical and sessile too. Here, I decided to showcase the Giant Barrel Sponge, also known as the <i>Xestospongia muta</i>. This animal lives mostly in the Gulf of America, near the Carribean Islands. Its diet consists of bacteria and plankton, as well as any other nutrition dissolved in the waters. The Giant Barrel Sponge, along with the whole phylum of Porifera, filter water through their pores and collect the food so that they can eat.</p>
