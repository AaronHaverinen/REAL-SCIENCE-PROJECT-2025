        <h2>The Lion's Mane Jellyfish</h2>
        <p>Our next phylum is named Cnidaria. Cnidaria can range from corals to jellyfish. This is the only phylum that has both medusa and polyp stages, meaning that it can start from looking like a plant into the ocean, and then grow into something that looks like a fish. Cnidaria are symmetrical, producing both sexually and asexually like Porifera. This is also the only phylum that uses tentacles to sting and catch prey. Here, I decided to display the Lion's Mane Jellyfish, also known as the <i>Cyanea capillata</i>. The Lions Mane Jellyfish lives in the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific Oceans, eating zooplankton, small fish, and even other jellyfish! The tentacles of this jellyfish can get as long as a hundred feet and its bell is around 8 feet in diameter. That's huge!</p>
